    - \b rkillcuik Aborts a execution of \ref cuik.c "cuik" already running on our in-house cluster.   
    - \b cuikmove To interactively move mechanisms (without taking into account the loop closure constraints) .   
    - \b cuikexplore To interactively move mechanisms (taking into account the loop closure constraints).
