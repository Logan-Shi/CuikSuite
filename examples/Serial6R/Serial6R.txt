   <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

   A 6R manipulator is a 
   chain of seven links L<sub>0</sub>,L<sub>1</sub>, ..., L<sub>6</sub>, 
   where L<sub>i</sub> is connected to L<sub>i+1</sub> with a revolute 
   joint. Link L<sub>0</sub> is the "ground" and link L<sub>6</sub> is 
   the "end effector" (usually a gripper). The problem is to compute
   which joint angles are required to place the end effector
   at a given position and orientation in 3-space. 
   Note that, since the ground and the end effector have fixed 
   relative positions, they can be viewed as a single rigid body. Thus, the
   inverse kinematic problem is equivalent to finding all possible 
   configurations of a general 6R loop like the one depicted above.

   For more 
   than a decade this was one of the principal problems of Robot 
   Kinematics. The first efficient solution is due to <a href="#raghavan1993">[Raghavan and 
   Roth 1993]</a> who obtained a minimum-degree resultant for this problem.
   Using this technique, the problem can be solved in a few milliseconds 
   on a standard computer <a href="#manocha1994">[Manocha and Canny 1994]</a>. Although the CUIK
   solution is slower, it is less affected by the presence of equation 
   singularities, and it can deal with paradoxical 6R loops with 
   positive-dimensional solution spaces.

   <h2><a name="geom">Geometry<a></h2>

   The usual way to parametrize a serial chain is giving the
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics_conventions">Denavit-Hartenberg</a> 
   parameters. In this convention, three parameters (\f$ a_i, d_i, \alpha_i \f$) 
   relate the frame of reference attached to link \f$i\f$ with that attached to
   link  \f$i+1\f$. See the figure below for an interpretation of these parameters.

   <h2><a name="forms">Formulations<a></h2>

   In this directory the following 6R-chain formulations are provided:
     - \ref Serial6R.world is a 6R with 16 isolated solutions, the maximum
       possible number of solutinos a 6R can have.
     - \ref Serial6RBricard.world is an architecturally singular 6R. 
     - \ref Serial6R1dof.world  is an architecturally singular 6R. 
     - \ref Serial6RRX60.world is 6R chain that appear in a industrial robot arm. 
     .
   Please, check the individual files for the Denavit-Hartenberg in each case.
