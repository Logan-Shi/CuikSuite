   <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
   
   Mutlifingered hands are increasingly used as a means of endowing 
   a robot with dexterity and versatility. The ability of such hands 
   to reconfigure themselves reduces the need for changing end-effectors, 
   and the large number of lightweight actuators associated with their 
   degrees of freedom allows for fast, precise, energy-efficient motions 
   of the object held in the hand.

   The existing Literature already offers a few solutions to the 
   inverse kinematics of robot hands, but all of them are based on 
   local search methods. Drawbacks of such methods include the fact 
   that they just provide one hand configuration for the given contact 
   points (determined by an initial estimation) and that their 
   convergence to a solution is not always guaranteed. While the 
   former drawback prevents choosing, among several solutions, those 
   that satisfy some optimality criterion based on stability, 
   manipulability, or energy consumption, for example, the second 
   drawback impedes obtaining a reliable answer of whether the hand 
   can actually reach the contact points. The purpose of this benchmark 
   is to illustrate how the use of CUIK can help overcoming such 
   limitations by directly computing all possible hand configurations.

   Although the geometric parameters of the hand below are those 
   of the <a href="http://www.ioc.upc.edu/recerca/ris/personal/raul-suarez/imatges/foto-mano.jpg"> MA-I hand </a> 
   developed at the <a href="http://www.ioc.upc.edu"> IOC </a> Robotics Lab, 
   the kinematic model assumed is that of a general anthropomorphic hand,
   and the technique is thus applicable to any hand following such structure. 
   In fact, hands with a different structure could also be treated, 
   by modelling them appropriately using the systematics provided in 
   <a href="#porta2008">[Porta et al. 2008]</a>.


   <h2><a name="geom">Geometry<a></h2>

   Anthropomorhic hands are made up of a palm and several fingers, one of them 
   acting as a thumb. Non-thumb fingers are normally aligned with each other and 
   with the palm, and they can push against the thumb. The MA-I hand follows this 
   scheme, as shown next:

   The fingers of this hand also follow the conventional anthropomorphic 
   structure, forming a serial chain with four revolute joints. The first 
   and second joints model the metacarpophalangeal joint (abduction/adduction 
   and flexion/extension movements) and are, together, equivalent to a universal 
   joint. The third and fourth joints model, respectively, the proximal and distal 
   interphalangeal joints (flexion/extension movement). 
   The model for finger \e j (left) and its contact with the object 
   (right) are shown below. Joints are represented as cylinders aligned with their axes.
