     A ball moving on a torus with many obstacles. We use this benchmark to test path planning algorithms since, due to its simplicity it is straightforward to visualize the results.

     We performed different experiments on this problem:
         - \ref torus.world The start and goal configurations can only be connected crossing a narrow corridor.
	 - \ref torus2.world A simpler problem where there is a long, easy to find path to the goal and a shorter path (but across a narrow corridor which is harder to find). We use
	    this problem to test asymptotically-optimal planners on manifolds
	 .
