    This folder includes several files:

      - The file \ref FourBars.world includes the kinematic formulation of the four-bar mechanism and
         is used for position analysis.
      - The file \ref FourBars_extraeq.world is an example of how to add user-provided equations to the
         ones automatically generated from the world file. The file defines a four bar open on one
         of its joints but the user provided equation enforces the loop closure. Please, see the
         file for more details. 
      - The file \ref FourBars_pendulum.world is a variant of where
         the four bar works as a pendulum with limited torque. Thus, in this case the planning to move the
         \e pendulum is harder since the bar that plays the role of pendulum has to be swing to gain momentum.
         This is a variant of a classical problem in path planning with dynamic constraints.  
      - The file \ref FourBars_rehab.world also includes dynamic and models a rehabilitation machine.
         This is a work in progress.
