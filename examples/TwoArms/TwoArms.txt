    Two planar robot arms cooperatively to move an object among obstacles

    This example was provided by <a href="http://homepages.laas.fr/jcortes/">Juan Cortes</a>.

    We used this example in our
    <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/porta/Docs/iros07.pdf">IROS-07</a> paper to
    evaluate our first path planner for systems with kinematic constraints.
    Note that this planer is not included in the CuikSuite since our recent developments
    clearly improved this planner.

    The two instances of this problem in this folder are only different on the set of
    obstacles surrounding the robots.

   The key data for this problem are:
   <center>
   <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Ambient space dimension</th> <td align="center"> 6 </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Configuration space dimension</th> <td align="center"> 3 </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Average planning time (for \ref TwoArmsA.world) with \ref cuikatlasrrt.c  "bin/cuikatlasrrt" (in seconds)</th> <td align="center"> 0.3 </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <th>Average planning time (for \ref TwoArmsB.world) with \ref cuikatlasrrt.c  "bin/cuikatlasrrt" (in seconds)</th> <td align="center"> 0.5 </td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   </center>

   Please, check each individual file for details on how to process them
      - \ref TwoArmsA.world A case with only the obstacles around the start and goal configurations.
      - \ref TwoArmsB.world A case with additional obstacles.
