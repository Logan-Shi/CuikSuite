/**

   \brief Variant of the example2 problem.

   This is a variant of the example2 problem (see \ref examples/Symmetry).

   This file is used to desing the actual mechanisms and, so, the sizes of the atoms, bond lengths and bond angles
   are carefully adjusted to have a rich configuration space but to avoid collisions at the same time.
   
   Note that while the example2 problem lead to three different solution curves, this variant
   has four of them (and they are longer).
