    A simple tutorial to introduce the CuikSuite tools.

    In this example we have a planar serial robot with 3 degrees of freedom that has to weld on a beam. In a first
    case the robot only has to weld on a point and it has to reach it with a given orientation. In the
    second case, the robot has to weld a line on the beam with the welding tool orthogonal to the beam.
    Finally, the task is relaxed to weld a line on the beam but allowing any orientation of the welding tool.
    The less the constraints on the welding tool, the higher the dimension of the configuration space to
    explore.

   This example is used as a small tutorial introducing the tools in the CuikSuite. The tutorial
   starts by the simplest case (with 0-dimensional solution sets solved using branch-and-prune techniques)
   and goes to more complex situations (2-dimensional solution sets explored using higher-dimensional
   continuation techniques). Please, follow the steps below to replicate the results in the paper:

      - \ref Welding0D.world "Address the 0-dimensional case" using branch-and-bound techniques.
      - \ref Welding1D.world "Address the 1-dimensional case" using branch-and-bound techniques. 
      - \ref Welding_open.world "Compute the borders of the reachable workspace" using branch-and-bound techniques. 
      - \ref Welding2D.world "Address the 2-dimensional case" using higher-dimensional techniques.
      - \ref Welding2D_limited.world "A path planning exercice" on the 2-dimensional case using higher-dimensional techniques.
