     \brief URDF file to illustrate \ref cuikurdf2world.cpp "cuikurdf2world".

    We use an URDF file  for the <a href="https://robots.ieee.org/robots/wam/">Wam robot</a>
    to illustrate the procedure to automatically convert URDF files to world files. These world
    files can be direclyt used by the CuikSuite. Thus, this procedure allows to rapidly incorporate new robot models
    to the CuikSuite.

    For information about ROS and URDF files please see http://www.ros.org 
    
    The \ref cuikurdf2world.cpp "cuikurdf2world" tool does not link with any ROS library, but it directly parses the URDF files using
    tinyxml2. In this way CuikSuite keeps its dependencies to a minimum. The problem with this approach is that
    changes in the URDF file format will not be automatically incorporated into the CuikSuite. Moreover, we do not
    consider xacro scritps, but only URDF files. If only have xacro files you will need to install ROS
    and execute
    	- rosrun xacro xacro --inorder -o model.urdf model.urdf.xacro
	.

    To process this example execute:
        - Convert the URDF file to a world file:
	  	  - \ref cuikurdf2world.cpp "bin/cuikurdf2world" . examples/URDF wam.urdf
	  	  .
        - Visualize and move the resulting robot model:
	  	  - \ref cuikmove.c "scripts/cuikmove" examples/URDF/wam
	  	  .
        .

        For any process using this generated file you will need a file of parametes. Just copy one from another example:
	  	  - cp examples/Barret/BarretArm.param examples/URDF/wam.param
	  	  .
		  
	The default conversion activates the collision detection between all pairs of links. Just edit the
	collision section in the last part of the world file to change this setting.
