    In this problem, we determine how should the hand be configured relative to the object so that
    a given a number of regions on the surface of the hand, and a number of corresponding regions 
    on the surface of the object establishes contact.


    Here you have summary of the results. In this summary \f$n_v\f$ is the number of variables of the problem
     \f$n_e\f$ is the number of equations and  \f$d\f$ is the dimension of the solution set. The execution time
     include the process to find the first valid solution. The results were obtained in a grid including 64 cores.
     For more details check the <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/porta/Docs/ijrr11.pdf">paper</a>.
    
    Any further questions regarding the files in this folder should be
