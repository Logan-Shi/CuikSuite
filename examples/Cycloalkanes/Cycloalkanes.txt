    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloalkane">cycloalkanes</a>
    are molecules that include loops of carbon atoms. The presence of
    a loop constraint makes \b CuikSuite specially adequate tool
    to analyze their conformational space.
    
    Note that the formulation we use here for the cycloalkanes is not
    based on distances (as we did in our 
    <a href="#porta2007">JCC paper</a>), but on vectors
    and rotation matrices, as in our more recent <a href="#porta2008">TRO paper</a>.

    Moreover, note that in the formulation of the cycloalkanes, we use a variant of
    the formulation described in our recent
    <a href="#porta2008">TRO paper</a>. 
    We do not use orthonormal reference frames for the links but
    we use the two vectors aligned with the rotation axis coincident in each carbon
    to defined a non-orthogonal reference frame. This produces equation sets that 
    can be easily simplified avoiding numerical issues.
    <br>
    The generalization to use non-orthonormal reference frames whe it is advantageous
    is applied in general and not only in these examples, howerver the effect is specially
    relevant in the cycloalkanes.
