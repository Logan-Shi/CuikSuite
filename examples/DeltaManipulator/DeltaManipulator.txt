    The Delta parallel manipulator is a 3 degrees-of-freedom parallel platform designed by 
    Reymond Clavel. This folder includes two versions of this manipulator:

      - \ref DeltaManipulator.world which  closely follows the original design. wW mainly use it for position analysis purposes. 
      - \ref Delta_dynamics.world which is a simplified version where the four bar mechanisms in the legs are replaced by a couple
         of universal joints (the resulting mobility is the same). We use this version mainly for kinodynamic planning since it
	 includes al the dynamic variables (masses, frictions, etc.).
