      Planar linkages used to test singularity-related tools. 

      This folder includes mechanisms from where we generate
      equations.
      Then, these equations are extended with singularity related
      equations (for instance, to isolate the singularity
      loci or the workspace boundaries). 
      The extended equation files are solve using cuik.
      
      Note that the examples included in this file are relatively simple.
      More complex singularity-related problems can be addressed
      with the CuikSuite tools, but up to now we do not have tools
      to automatically generate the necessary equations. This is part
      of our futher developments

      For more complex examples, please check our <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/ros/Separates/sci-16-r14-tro-workspaces.pdf>TRO-12</a> and
      <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/ros/Separates/sci-17-r15-asme-workspace-stewart.pdf">JMR-13</a> papers.
      
      Please, have a look to the two files included in this folder for more details on
      how to process them:

         - 3R.world Wokspace computation of a 3R robot.
	 - PlanarParallel.world  Workspace computation of a planar parallel robot.
	 .

     \todo Develop tools to automatically generate the equations for the singularity-related problems.
