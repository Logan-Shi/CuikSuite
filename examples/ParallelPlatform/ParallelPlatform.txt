    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

   This device is a generalization of a mechanism originally proposed by Stewart 
   as a flight simulator. It consists of two rigid bodies, a fixed "base" and a moving 
   "platform", which are held fixed one to the other by means of six legs. 
   The legs are connected to the base and platform bodies via 
   spherical joints, and their lengths can be changed by means of linear 
   actuators. No further geometric constraints are assumed for the device. 
   In particular, the base and platform joints need not be coplanar.
   
   While the inverse kinematics of this mechanism is straightforward (given the platform 
   pose, derive the leg lengths) the converse problem (given the leg lengths, 
   derive the platform pose) is by no means trivial and can have many different
   solutions. In fact, for a long time, it has been considered one
   of the most difficult problems of robot kinematics.

    The geometry of a parallel platform is given by the leg lengths \f$l_i\f$ and by the anchor
    points of the legs on the base \f$A_i\f$ and on the platform \f$B_i\f$, for \f$i=1..6\f$.

    <h2><a name="intro">Formulations</a></h2>

    This directory includes formulations for three different parallel platforms:

      - Dietmeier.world A parallel platform with 40 solutions, the maximum possible number
        of solutions for a parallel platform.
      - Griffis-Duffy.world An architecturally singular parallel platform.
      - Rotational.world A highly constrained parallel platform that only has rotational
        degrees of freedom. We use it basically for a path planning experiment. 
      - Rotational2.world A variation of the rotation-only parallel platform.
