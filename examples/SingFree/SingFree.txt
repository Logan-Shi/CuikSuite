   \brief Singularity free path planning.

   <center>
     <i>Schematic representation of the idea used to determine singularity-free paths. The singularity-free region of the configuration space
     is formalized as a manifold with the help of an auxiliary
     variable, <i>b</i> sending the singularities (the red curves in
     the plot) to infinity. Singularity-free paths are determined by navigating this
     new manifold.</i>

    This folder includes examples of how to define and process the appropriate equation to
    perform singularity-free path planning using the CuikSuite.

    Note that in this case we do not define worlds, but directly cuik files. We add
    the singularity condition to these files, and equations to avoid reaching 
    configurations where this condition holds.
    The singlarity condition is the determinant of the Jacobian.
    The equations to avoid the singlarity basically sends the singular configurations
    to the infinity by including an equation d*b=1, where d is the value of the determinant.
    The singularity loci can be computed by removing this equation, removing the variable
    b, adding an equation d=0, and using cuik. The full configuration space can be
    obtained witout considering the determinant constraint.

    Two files are included in this folder
       - simple.cuik (with the aixiliary files simple_full.cuik simple_sing.cuik)
       - 3RPR.cuik (with the aixiliary files 3RPR_full.cuik 3RPR_sing.cuik)
       .

      Next, we detail the steps to find a singularity-free path and how to obtain a representation of this path:

      First we obtain the singularity-free solution path (and we plot it)
       - <i>\ref cuikatlasAstar.c "bin/cuikatlasAstar" examples/SingFree/simple</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikplotatlas.c "bin/cuikplotatlas"  examples/SingFree/simple 0 1 2</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikplotpath.c "bin/cuikplotpath"  examples/SingFree/simple 0 1 2</i>
       .
     
     For represenation purposes,  we then compute the full atlas (and we plot it)
       - <i>\ref cuikatlas.c "bin/cuikatlas" examples/SingFree/simple_full</i>
       - <i>\ref cuiktriangulateatlas.c "bin/cuiktriangulateatlas" examples/SingFree/simple_full 0 1 2</i>
       .

    Moreover, to get nice final plot, we also compute the singularity loci and we plot it. Note that computing the singularity
    loci is significantly more expensive than computing the singularity-free path. This is the advantage of considering
    the singularities in implicit form during planning.
       - <i>\ref cuik.c "bin/cuik" examples/SingFree/simple_sing</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikplot3d.c "bin/cuikplot3d" examples/SingFree/simple_sing 1 2 3 0 simple_sing.gcl</i>
       .
       
    And now everything can be visualized executing
       - <i>geomview simple_sing.gcl examples/SingFree/simple_full_atlas_triang.gcl examples/SingFree/simple_atlas.gcl examples/SingFree/simple_path.gcl</i>
       .

    After some manipulation in geomview (to change colors, etc.) you will get this plot:

    The same can be done with the 3RPR example (the only difference is that we do not triangulate the full atlas, but we plot it directly since it is much faster):
       - <i>\ref cuikatlasAstar.c "bin/cuikatlasAstar" examples/SingFree/3RPR</i>	 
       - <i>\ref cuikplotatlas.c "bin/cuikplotatlas" examples/SingFree/3RPR 0 1 2</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikatlas.c "bin/cuikatlas" examples/SingFree/3RPR_full</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikplotatlas.c "bin/cuikplotatlas"  examples/SingFree/3RPR 0 1 2</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikplotpath.c "bin/cuikplotpath"  examples/SingFree/3RPR 0 1 2</i>
       - <i>\ref cuik.c "bin/cuik" examples/SingFree/3RPR_sing</i>
       - <i>\ref cuikplot3d.c "bin/cuikplot3d" examples/SingFree/3RPR_sing 1 2 3 0 3RPR_sing.gcl</i>
       - <i>geomview 3RPR_sing.gcl examples/SingFree/3RPR_full_atlas.gcl examples/SingFree/3RPR_atlas.gcl examples/SingFree/3RPR_path.gcl</i>
       .

      Again, after some manipulation in geomview you will get this figure:
