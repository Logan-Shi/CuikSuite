   <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

   All members of the \e Wheelie family have two particularities: 
       - They cannot be solved in closed form.
       - Their position analysis cannot be decomposed into simpler problems. In other words,
         it cannot be solved by merging the solutions 
         of sub-linkage modules.
       .
   The first property derives from the fact that the linkage graphs are planar and triconnected and, 
   by the Owen-Power theorem, this implies their solution cannot be found by ruler-and-compass 
   methods <a href="#owen2007">[Owen 2007]</a>.
   The second property can be proved by showing that such graphs only contain a single 
   triconnected component. Thus, solvers based on ruler-and-compass methods or on modular 
   kinematics cannot solve such linkages. 
   Therefore, the \e Wheelie linkages are a perfect scalable testbed for 
   general position analysis algorithms.

   As it can be seen in the figure above, a \e T-Wheelie linkage 
   is formed by a loop of \e T equally sized isosceles triangles 
   generated from two concentric circles and where the triangles are connected  
   with the following pattern:
     - Two consecutive triangles around the circle are connected by two bars.
     - Two triangles with one triangle in between are directly connected by one bar.
     - The linkage is made rigig adding (T-6)/2 bars, creating (T-6)/2 adjacent triangles 
       in the interior circle. 
     .

   Please, see the individual files for the instructions on how to process them:
      - \ref Wheelie6.world "Wheelie6" A wheelie with 6 triangles. 
      - \ref Wheelie8.world "Wheelie8" A wheelie with 8 triangles. 
      - \ref Wheelie10.world "Wheelie10" A wheelie with 10 triangles.
      - \ref Wheelie6mobile.world "Wheelie6mobile" A wheelie with 6 triangles where
        one of the bars is removed. With this, the configuration space is one-dimensional
        instead of zero-dimensional.
      .

   The execution times can be significantly reduced executing \ref cuik.c "cuik" on a cluster of 
   computers. This is easy using the rmpicuik script (assuming that you have a properly
   configured cluster of computers).

   <h2><a name="res">Results</a></h2>

   These are the 19 valid configuraions of the  \ref Wheelie6.world problem:

   This is a projection of the one-dimensional configuration space of the \ref Wheelie6mobile.world problem.

   </center>

   Actually, this configuration space contains 16 connected components, corresponding to 16 different assembly modes of the linkage. 
   One of such modes is rigid, and the remaining ones are mobile. The mobile modes show up as disjoint closed curves in the above plot 
   (they are better appreciated in the 3d plot, as seen with geomview).
