    Example used in the <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/porta/Docs/iros11.pdf">IROS-11</a>
    paper.

    This is experimental stage and for our internal use only. This was our first attempt to include differential
    constraints into the constraints treated by the CuikSuite. We aim to continue this work in the future.

    Any question regarding the files in this folder should be
    addressed to Leonard Jaillet.
