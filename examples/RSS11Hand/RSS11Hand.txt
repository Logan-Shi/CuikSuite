   The manipulation examples used in the <a href="http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/porta/Docs/rss11.pdf">RSS-11</a>
   paper. The paper is about the optimization of robotics graps.

   Please, check the scripts
        - scripts/RSSChain_can
	- scripts/RSSChain_can2
	- scripts/RSSChain_setrill
	- scripts/RSSChain_setrill2
	- scripts/RSSChain_tornavis
	- scripts/RSSChain_tornavis2
	.
    for detailed instructions on how to process these problems. To use these scripts
    you need to install Matlab.

    Note that the procedure is quite involved because it uses many of
    the applications in the CuikSuite and combines them with matlab to
    compute the contact equations and the manipulability indices.
    Moreover, the problems in this folder are slight variations of those
    in the paper (namely, the contact points are different). Thus, the
    final atlas are not exactly the same as those in the paper, but
    equivalent.

    Questions regarding these examples should be addressed to Carlos Rosales.
