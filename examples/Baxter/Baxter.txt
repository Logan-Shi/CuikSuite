   \brief The Baxter robot

   The robot arms developed by <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com">Rethink Robotics</a>.
      
   We use this example to define CuikSuite robot models form ROS URDF files. The files in the
   folder examples/Baxter/baxter_description have been downloaded from the 
   <a href="https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_common">Rethink Robotics GitHub</a>. With these files we can execute
	- \ref cuikurdf2world.cpp "bin/cuikurdf2world" examples/Baxter baxter_description/urdf/baxter.urdf examples/Baxter/baxter
	.

   to automatically generate a baxter.world file that can be manipulated as the usual word files. For instance you can execute
      - ref cuikmove.c "scripts/cuikmove" examples/Baxter/baxter.world
      .
   to manipulate the robot (colors will not match those in the actual robot).

   Note that the URDF does not model the grippers and, thus, they are not included in the world file.

   Beside the imported file, this folder includes a planning example with the Baxter robot (see the \ref baxter_box.world ).
