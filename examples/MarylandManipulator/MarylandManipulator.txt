    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

    The Maryland parallel manipulator is a 3 degrees-of-freedom parallel platform designed by 
    <a href="http://www.isr.umd.edu/People/faculty/Tsai.html">Prof. Lung-Wen Tsai</a>
    at the University of Maryland  

    The key idea in the design is the use of parallelograms (i.e., 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_bar_linkage">four bar mechanisms</a>) 
    in each leg to constraint the movement of the platform to only
    translational degrees of freedom.

    Note that the design is very similar to that of the 
    \ref examples/DeltaManipulator "Delta robot" but here only
    revolute joints are used to define the leg parallelograms. In the Delta robot spherical 
    joints are used and, thent the parallelograms are not enforced to be coplanar.

    <h2><a name="geom">Geometry</a></h2>

    Three identical limbs connect the base and the platform. Each leg is formed by a
    lower arm and an upper arm connected between them with a revolute joint. 
    The lower limb is simple bar and
    the upper limb is made up of a plannar four-bar parallelogram. 
    The lower and upper arms are connected to the base and platform 
    with revolute joints, respectively. The axes of the revolute joints at the base and
    at the platforma are coplanar. Moreover, the three axis of the three revolute joints
    for each leg (the one connecting the lower limb and the base, the one
    connecting the two limbs, and the one connecting the upper limb and the platform) 
    are parallel. Finally, the axes of the four-bar mechanism forming the upper limb 
    are perpendicular to the plane defined by two axes of the  revolute joints 
    linking the parallelogram to the lower limb and the platform.

    In the simplest possible version of this mechanism, the platform parameters are the 
    lengths of the limbs and the the anchor points of the legs at the base/platform.
    The axis of the revolute joints connecting the base and the legs can be taken as
    tangent to the circunference inscribing the triangle formed by the anchor points.

    See <a href="#tsai1999">[Tsai, 1999]</a> for a complete description and analysis of this
    mechanism.

    This example is treated following this steps (from the main CuikSuite folder):

     - <b>Generate the equations</b>:
        Execute
             - <i> \ref cuikequations.c "bin/cuikequations" examples/MarylandManipulator/MarylandManipulator</i>
             .
     - <b>Solve the positional analysis problem</b>: Execute
             - <i> \ref cuik.c "bin/cuik" examples/MarylandManipulator/MarylandManipulator </i>
             .
